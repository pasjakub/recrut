I couldn't finish this task, as I wasn't been able to test anything due to some issues with my virtualization on computer. I didn't have access to other computer till the deadline, and any troubleshooting didn't help.

My thoughts on this task:

Manual configuration of nginx and creating some virutal hosts which checks the URL and redirects accordingly to the CentOS server or Ubuntu server. The servers created with Vagrant and configured with Ansible should change the default /var/www/index.html to the template with given distribution name and hostname.
